# Python Data Science Handbook Notes 📘🔬

This repository contains my learning notes and practice notebooks based on the **Python Data Science Handbook** by **Jake VanderPlas**. I've created topic-wise [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebooks with detailed explanations, code implementations, and summary notes to reinforce my understanding and support future revisions.

## 📌 Why I Created This Repo

- 🧠 To **deepen my understanding** of foundational data science concepts
- 🔁 To **revise** important chapters easily
- ✍️ To maintain a **topic-by-topic structured notebook collection**
- 🔗 To combine theory, code, and practical insights for better retention
